Psuedo code for test 1:

First we will need to create a abstract class called employees that will be contain the functions getSalary and getRace in order to perform sorts
on each employee in the health care system.

Then we will need to create a class BostonEmp, that will be responsible for managing all the employees from the boston location.
This will allow us to create a compareTo class based on each salary

Doctor, Executive, Nurse will extend the boston employee class, allowing for each class to differ in salary calculations, bonuses, and
other important details.

We will create a generic manager class that will allow us to sort any object given that the object has some sort of value to compare on.
So, for employees, we will utilize the compare to method on their salaries.
